                    Perceptual Illusions contain conflicting data that cause you to
                    perceive the image in a way that differs from reality. However, 
                    an illusion is not always a misinterpretation, but rather it convinces
                    us that the real-life version of an object is false. 
                    Through the experience of basic interaction with objects, the brain builds
                    perceptual categories of objects. The perceptual categories then serve as
                    templates where perception occurs through the process of matching
                    sensory input patterns to <a href="perceptual_templates.html">perceptual
                    templates</a>. The matching process is
                    what gives us the experience of ground relationships.
                    A way to test the reliability of these perceptual templates is through
                    perceptual illusions. They provide a way to experience the template
                    matching process first hand.

                    Cognitive illusions (one of three types of illusions; literal, physiological, cognitive)
                    can be defined as unconscious interferences with an object from the
                    viewer's knowledge and assumptions about the world. There are three types
                    of cognitive illusions:

                        Allows the viewer to have two valid interpretations of the object.
                        They can visualise both interpretations at different times. However, 
                        both cannot be seen at the same time as it would interfere with the full perception 
                        of either one, and the brain simply does not allow that.
